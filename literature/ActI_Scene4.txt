A street.
 
2
[Enter ROMEO, MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, with five or six [p]Maskers, Torch-bearers, and others]
 
3
Romeo.
4
      What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
5
      Or shall we on without a apology?
6
Benvolio.
7
      The date is out of such prolixity:
8
      We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,
9
      Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,
10
      Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;
11
      Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
12
      After the prompter, for our entrance:
13
      But let them measure us by what they will;
14
      We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.
15
Romeo.
16
      Give me a torch: I am not for this ambling;
17
      Being but heavy, I will bear the light.
18
Mercutio.
19
      Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
20
Romeo.
21
      Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes
22
      With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
23
      So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
24
Mercutio.
25
      You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,
26
      And soar with them above a common bound.
27
Romeo.
28
      I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
29
      To soar with his light feathers, and so bound,
30
      I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:
31
      Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
32
Mercutio.
33
      And, to sink in it, should you burden love;
34
      Too great oppression for a tender thing.
35
Romeo.
36
      Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,
37
      Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
38
Mercutio.
39
      If love be rough with you, be rough with love;
40
      Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
41
      Give me a case to put my visage in:
42
      A visor for a visor! what care I
43
      What curious eye doth quote deformities?
44
      Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.
45
Benvolio.
46
      Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in,
47
      But every man betake him to his legs.
48
Romeo.
49
      A torch for me: let wantons light of heart
50
      Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels,
51
      For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase;
52
      I'll be a candle-holder, and look on.
53
      The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.
54
Mercutio.
55
      Tut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word:
56
      If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
57
      Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st
58
      Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!
59
Romeo.
60
      Nay, that's not so.
61
Mercutio.
62
      I mean, sir, in delay
63
      We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.
64
      Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
65
      Five times in that ere once in our five wits.
66
Romeo.
67
      And we mean well in going to this mask;
68
      But 'tis no wit to go.
69
Mercutio.
70
      Why, may one ask?
71
Romeo.
72
      I dream'd a dream to-night.
73
Mercutio.
74
      And so did I.
75
Romeo.
76
      Well, what was yours?
77
Mercutio.
78
      That dreamers often lie.
79
Romeo.
80
      In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
81
Mercutio.
82
      O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
83
      She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
84
      In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
85
      On the fore-finger of an alderman,
86
      Drawn with a team of little atomies
87
      Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;
88
      Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,
89
      The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,
90
      The traces of the smallest spider's web,
91
      The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,
92
      Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,
93
      Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,
94
      Not so big as a round little worm
95
      Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
96
      Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut
97
      Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
98
      Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
99
      And in this state she gallops night by night
100
      Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
101
      O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight,
102
      O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees,
103
      O'er ladies ' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
104
      Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
105
      Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:
106
      Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
107
      And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
108
      And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail
109
      Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,
110
      Then dreams, he of another benefice:
111
      Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
112
      And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
113
      Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
114
      Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon
115
      Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,
116
      And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
117
      And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
118
      That plats the manes of horses in the night,
119
      And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,
120
      Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes:
121
      This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
122
      That presses them and learns them first to bear,
123
      Making them women of good carriage:
124
      This is she—
125
Romeo.
126
      Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
127
      Thou talk'st of nothing.
128
Mercutio.
129
      True, I talk of dreams,
130
      Which are the children of an idle brain,
131
      Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,
132
      Which is as thin of substance as the air
133
      And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
134
      Even now the frozen bosom of the north,
135
      And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
136
      Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.
137
Benvolio.
138
      This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves;
139
      Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
140
Romeo.
 
141
      I fear, too early: for my mind misgives
142
      Some consequence yet hanging in the stars
143
      Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
144
      With this night's revels and expire the term
145
      Of a despised life closed in my breast
146
      By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
147
      But He, that hath the steerage of my course,
148
      Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.
149
Benvolio.
150
      Strike, drum.
 
151
[Exeunt]
