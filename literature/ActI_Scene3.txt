1
A room in Capulet’s house.
 
2
[Enter LADY CAPULET and Nurse]
 
3
Lady Capulet.
4
      Nurse, where's my daughter? call her forth to me.
5
Nurse.
6
      Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,
7
      I bade her come. What, lamb! what, ladybird!
8
      God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!
 
9
[Enter JULIET]
 
10
Juliet.
11
      How now! who calls?
12
Nurse.
13
      Your mother.
14
Juliet.
15
      Madam, I am here.
16
      What is your will?
17
Lady Capulet.
18
      This is the matter:—Nurse, give leave awhile,
19
      We must talk in secret:—nurse, come back again;
20
      I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel.
21
      Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.
22
Nurse.
23
      Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.
24
Lady Capulet.
25
      She's not fourteen.
26
Nurse.
27
      I'll lay fourteen of my teeth,—
28
      And yet, to my teeth be it spoken, I have but four—
29
      She is not fourteen. How long is it now
30
      To Lammas-tide?
31
Lady Capulet.
32
      A fortnight and odd days.
33
Nurse.
34
      Even or odd, of all days in the year,
35
      Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.
36
      Susan and she—God rest all Christian souls!—
37
      Were of an age: well, Susan is with God;
38
      She was too good for me: but, as I said,
39
      On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;
40
      That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
41
      'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
42
      And she was wean'd,—I never shall forget it,—
43
      Of all the days of the year, upon that day:
44
      For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
45
      Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;
46
      My lord and you were then at Mantua:—
47
      Nay, I do bear a brain:—but, as I said,
48
      When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
49
      Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
50
      To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!
51
      Shake quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow,
52
      To bid me trudge:
53
      And since that time it is eleven years;
54
      For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood,
55
      She could have run and waddled all about;
56
      For even the day before, she broke her brow:
57
      And then my husband—God be with his soul!
58
      A' was a merry man—took up the child:
59
      'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?
60
      Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
61
      Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame,
62
      The pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay.'
63
      To see, now, how a jest shall come about!
64
      I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,
65
      I never should forget it: 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he;
66
      And, pretty fool, it stinted and said 'Ay.'
67
Lady Capulet.
68
      Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.
69
Nurse.
70
      Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,
71
      To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'
72
      And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow
73
      A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;
74
      A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:
75
      'Yea,' quoth my husband,'fall'st upon thy face?
76
      Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;
77
      Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted and said 'Ay.'
78
Juliet.
79
      And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.
80
Nurse.
81
      Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!
82
      Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed:
83
      An I might live to see thee married once,
84
      I have my wish.
85
Lady Capulet.
86
      Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme
87
      I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,
88
      How stands your disposition to be married?
89
Juliet.
90
      It is an honour that I dream not of.
91
Nurse.
92
      An honour! were not I thine only nurse,
93
      I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.
94
Lady Capulet.
95
      Well, think of marriage now; younger than you,
96
      Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
97
      Are made already mothers: by my count,
98
      I was your mother much upon these years
99
      That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:
100
      The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
101
Nurse.
102
      A man, young lady! lady, such a man
103
      As all the world—why, he's a man of wax.
104
Lady Capulet.
105
      Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
106
Nurse.
107
      Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.
108
Lady Capulet.
109
      What say you? can you love the gentleman?
110
      This night you shall behold him at our feast;
111
      Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,
112
      And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;
113
      Examine every married lineament,
114
      And see how one another lends content
115
      And what obscured in this fair volume lies
116
      Find written in the margent of his eyes.
117
      This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
118
      To beautify him, only lacks a cover:
119
      The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride
120
      For fair without the fair within to hide:
121
      That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,
122
      That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
123
      So shall you share all that he doth possess,
124
      By having him, making yourself no less.
125
Nurse.
126
      No less! nay, bigger; women grow by men.
127
Lady Capulet.
128
      Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
129
Juliet.
130
      I'll look to like, if looking liking move:
131
      But no more deep will I endart mine eye
132
      Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.
 
133
[Enter a Servant]
 
134
Servant.
135
      Madam, the guests are come, supper served up, you
136
      called, my young lady asked for, the nurse cursed in
137
      the pantry, and every thing in extremity. I must
138
      hence to wait; I beseech you, follow straight.
139
Lady Capulet.
140
      We follow thee.
141
      [Exit Servant]
142
      Juliet, the county stays.
143
Nurse.
144
      Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
 
145
[Exeunt]
