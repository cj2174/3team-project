[Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers]
 
3
Sampson.
4
      Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.
5
Gregory.
6
      No, for then we should be colliers.
7
Sampson.
8
      I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
9
Gregory.
10
      Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.
11
Sampson.
12
      I strike quickly, being moved.
13
Gregory.
14
      But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
15
Sampson.
16
      A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
17
Gregory.
18
      To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:
19
      therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.
20
Sampson.
21
      A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will
22
      take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.
23
Gregory.
24
      That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes
25
      to the wall.
26
Sampson.
27
      True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
28
      are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push
29
      Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids
30
      to the wall.
31
Gregory.
32
      The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.
33
Sampson.
34
      'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I
35
      have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the
36
      maids, and cut off their heads.
37
Gregory.
38
      The heads of the maids?
39
Sampson.
40
      Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;
41
      take it in what sense thou wilt.
42
Gregory.
43
      They must take it in sense that feel it.
44
Sampson.
45
      Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and
46
      'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.
47
Gregory.
48
      'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou
49
      hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes
50
      two of the house of the Montagues.
51
Sampson.
52
      My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.
53
Gregory.
54
      How! turn thy back and run?
55
Sampson.
56
      Fear me not.
57
Gregory.
58
      No, marry; I fear thee!
59
Sampson.
60
      Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.
61
Gregory.
62
      I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as
63
      they list.
64
Sampson.
65
      Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them;
66
      which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
 
67
[Enter ABRAHAM and BALTHASAR]
 
68
Abraham.
69
      Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
70
Sampson.
71
      I do bite my thumb, sir.
72
Abraham.
73
      Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
74
Sampson.
75
      [Aside to GREGORY]Is the law of our side, if I say
76
      ay?
77
Gregory.
78
      No.
79
Sampson.
80
      No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I
81
      bite my thumb, sir.
82
Gregory.
83
      Do you quarrel, sir?
84
Abraham.
85
      Quarrel sir! no, sir.
86
Sampson.
87
      If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.
88
Abraham.
89
      No better.
90
Sampson.
91
      Well, sir.
92
Gregory.
93
      Say 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen.
94
Sampson.
95
      Yes, better, sir.
96
Abraham.
97
      You lie.
98
Sampson.
99
      Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.
 
100
[They fight]

[Enter BENVOLIO]
 
102
Benvolio.
103
      Part, fools!
104
      Put up your swords; you know not what you do.
 
105
[Beats down their swords]
