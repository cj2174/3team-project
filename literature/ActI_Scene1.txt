Verona. A public place.
 
2
[Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers]
 
3
Sampson.
4
      Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.
5
Gregory.
6
      No, for then we should be colliers.
7
Sampson.
8
      I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
9
Gregory.
10
      Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.
11
Sampson.
12
      I strike quickly, being moved.
13
Gregory.
14
      But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
15
Sampson.
16
      A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
17
Gregory.
18
      To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:
19
      therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.
20
Sampson.
21
      A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will
22
      take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.
23
Gregory.
24
      That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes
25
      to the wall.
26
Sampson.
27
      True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
28
      are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push
29
      Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids
30
      to the wall.
31
Gregory.
32
      The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.
33
Sampson.
34
      'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I
35
      have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the
36
      maids, and cut off their heads.
37
Gregory.
38
      The heads of the maids?
39
Sampson.
40
      Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;
41
      take it in what sense thou wilt.
42
Gregory.
43
      They must take it in sense that feel it.
44
Sampson.
45
      Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and
46
      'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.
47
Gregory.
48
      'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou
49
      hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes
50
      two of the house of the Montagues.
51
Sampson.
52
      My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.
53
Gregory.
54
      How! turn thy back and run?
55
Sampson.
56
      Fear me not.
57
Gregory.
58
      No, marry; I fear thee!
59
Sampson.
60
      Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.
61
Gregory.
62
      I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as
63
      they list.
64
Sampson.
65
      Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them;
66
      which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
 
67
[Enter ABRAHAM and BALTHASAR]
 
68
Abraham.
69
      Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
70
Sampson.
71
      I do bite my thumb, sir.
72
Abraham.
73
      Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
74
Sampson.
75
      [Aside to GREGORY]Is the law of our side, if I say
76
      ay?
77
Gregory.
78
      No.
79
Sampson.
80
      No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I
81
      bite my thumb, sir.
82
Gregory.
83
      Do you quarrel, sir?
84
Abraham.
85
      Quarrel sir! no, sir.
86
Sampson.
87
      If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.
88
Abraham.
89
      No better.
90
Sampson.
91
      Well, sir.
92
Gregory.
93
      Say 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen.
94
Sampson.
95
      Yes, better, sir.
96
Abraham.
97
      You lie.
98
Sampson.
99
      Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.
 
100
[They fight]
 
101
[Enter BENVOLIO]
 
102
Benvolio.
103
      Part, fools!
104
      Put up your swords; you know not what you do.
 
105
[Beats down their swords]
 
106
[Enter TYBALT]

107
Tybalt.
108
      What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
109
      Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.
110
Benvolio.
111
      I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,
112
      Or manage it to part these men with me.
113
Tybalt.
114
      What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,
115
      As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:
116
      Have at thee, coward!
117
      [They fight]
118
      [Enter, several of both houses, who join the fray;
119
      then enter Citizens, with clubs]
120
First Citizen.
121
      Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!
122
      Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!
 
123
[Enter CAPULET in his gown, and LADY CAPULET]
 
124
Capulet.
125
      What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!
126
Lady Capulet.
127
      A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?
128
Capulet.
129
      My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,
130
      And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
 
131
[Enter MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE]
 
132
Montague.
133
      Thou villain Capulet,—Hold me not, let me go.
134
Lady Montague.
135
      Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.
 
136
[Enter PRINCE, with Attendants]
 
137
Prince Escalus.
138
      Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
139
      Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,—
140
      Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
141
      That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
142
      With purple fountains issuing from your veins,
143
      On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
144
      Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,
145
      And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
146
      Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
147
      By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
148
      Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,
149
      And made Verona's ancient citizens
150
      Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
151
      To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
152
      Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:
153
      If ever you disturb our streets again,
154
      Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
155
      For this time, all the rest depart away:
156
      You Capulet; shall go along with me:
157
      And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
158
      To know our further pleasure in this case,
159
      To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.
160
      Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
 
161
[Exeunt all but MONTAGUE, LADY MONTAGUE, and BENVOLIO]
 
162
Montague.
163
      Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
164
      Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?
165
Benvolio.
166
      Here were the servants of your adversary,
167
      And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:
168
      I drew to part them: in the instant came
169
      The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,
170
      Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,
171
      He swung about his head and cut the winds,
172
      Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:
173
      While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
174
      Came more and more and fought on part and part,
175
      Till the prince came, who parted either part.
176
Lady Montague.
177
      O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?
178
      Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
179
Benvolio.
180
      Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
181
      Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,
182
      A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
183
      Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
184
      That westward rooteth from the city's side,
185
      So early walking did I see your son:
186
      Towards him I made, but he was ware of me
187
      And stole into the covert of the wood:
188
      I, measuring his affections by my own,
189
      That most are busied when they're most alone,
190
      Pursued my humour not pursuing his,
191
      And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.
192
Montague.
193
      Many a morning hath he there been seen,
194
      With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.
195
      Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
196
      But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
197
      Should in the furthest east begin to draw
198
      The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
199
      Away from the light steals home my heavy son,
200
      And private in his chamber pens himself,
201
      Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out
202
      And makes himself an artificial night:
203
      Black and portentous must this humour prove,
204
      Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
205
Benvolio.
206
      My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
207
Montague.
208
      I neither know it nor can learn of him.
209
Benvolio.
210
      Have you importuned him by any means?
211
Montague.
212
      Both by myself and many other friends:
213
      But he, his own affections' counsellor,
214
      Is to himself—I will not say how true—
215
      But to himself so secret and so close,
216
      So far from sounding and discovery,
217
      As is the bud bit with an envious worm,
218
      Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
219
      Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
220
      Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.
221
      We would as willingly give cure as know.
 
222
[Enter ROMEO]
 
223
Benvolio.
224
      See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;
225
      I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.
226
Montague.
227
      I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,
228
      To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away.
 
229
[Exeunt MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE]
 
230
Benvolio.
231
      Good-morrow, cousin.
232
Romeo.
233
      Is the day so young?
234
Benvolio.
235
      But new struck nine.
236
Romeo.
237
      Ay me! sad hours seem long.
238
      Was that my father that went hence so fast?
239
Benvolio.
240
      It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
241
Romeo.
242
      Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
243
Benvolio.
244
      In love?
245
Romeo.
246
      Out—
247
Benvolio.
248
      Of love?
249
Romeo.
250
      Out of her favour, where I am in love.
251
Benvolio.
252
      Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,
253
      Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
254
Romeo.
255
      Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,
256
      Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!
257
      Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
258
      Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
259
      Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
260
      Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
261
      O any thing, of nothing first create!
262
      O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
263
      Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
264
      Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,
265
      sick health!
266
      Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
267
      This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
268
      Dost thou not laugh?
269
Benvolio.
270
      No, coz, I rather weep.
271
Romeo.
272
      Good heart, at what?
273
Benvolio.
274
      At thy good heart's oppression.
275
Romeo.
276
      Why, such is love's transgression.
277
      Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
278
      Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
279
      With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown
280
      Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
281
      Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;
282
      Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
283
      Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:
284
      What is it else? a madness most discreet,
285
      A choking gall and a preserving sweet.
286
      Farewell, my coz.
287
Benvolio.
288
      Soft! I will go along;
289
      An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
290
Romeo.
291
      Tut, I have lost myself; I am not here;
292
      This is not Romeo, he's some other where.
293
Benvolio.
294
      Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
295
Romeo.
296
      What, shall I groan and tell thee?
297
Benvolio.
298
      Groan! why, no.
299
      But sadly tell me who.
300
Romeo.
301
      Bid a sick man in sadness make his will:
302
      Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!
303
      In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
304
Benvolio.
305
      I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
306
Romeo.
307
      A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love.
308
Benvolio.
309
      A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
310
Romeo.
311
      Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit
312
      With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;
313
      And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
314
      From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
315
      She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
316
      Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,
317
      Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:
318
      O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,
319
      That when she dies with beauty dies her store.
320
Benvolio.
321
      Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
322
Romeo.
323
      She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,
324
      For beauty starved with her severity
325
      Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
326
      She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
327
      To merit bliss by making me despair:
328
      She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
329
      Do I live dead that live to tell it now.
330
Benvolio.
331
      Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
332
Romeo.
333
      O, teach me how I should forget to think.
334
Benvolio.
335
      By giving liberty unto thine eyes;
336
      Examine other beauties.
337
Romeo.
338
      'Tis the way
339
      To call hers exquisite, in question more:
340
      These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows
341
      Being black put us in mind they hide the fair;
342
      He that is strucken blind cannot forget
343
      The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:
344
      Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
345
      What doth her beauty serve, but as a note
346
      Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
347
      Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.
348
Benvolio.
349
      I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.
 
350
[Exeunt]
