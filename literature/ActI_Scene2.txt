A street.
 
2
[Enter CAPULET, PARIS, and Servant]
 
3
Capulet.
4
      But Montague is bound as well as I,
5
      In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
6
      For men so old as we to keep the peace.
7
Paris.
8
      Of honourable reckoning are you both;
9
      And pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.
10
      But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?
11
Capulet.
12
      But saying o'er what I have said before:
13
      My child is yet a stranger in the world;
14
      She hath not seen the change of fourteen years,
15
      Let two more summers wither in their pride,
16
      Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
17
Paris.
18
      Younger than she are happy mothers made.
19
Capulet.
20
      And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
21
      The earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she,
22
      She is the hopeful lady of my earth:
23
      But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,
24
      My will to her consent is but a part;
25
      An she agree, within her scope of choice
26
      Lies my consent and fair according voice.
27
      This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,
28
      Whereto I have invited many a guest,
29
      Such as I love; and you, among the store,
30
      One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
31
      At my poor house look to behold this night
32
      Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
33
      Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
34
      When well-apparell'd April on the heel
35
      Of limping winter treads, even such delight
36
      Among fresh female buds shall you this night
37
      Inherit at my house; hear all, all see,
38
      And like her most whose merit most shall be:
39
      Which on more view, of many mine being one
40
      May stand in number, though in reckoning none,
41
      Come, go with me.
42
      [To Servant, giving a paper]
43
      Go, sirrah, trudge about
44
      Through fair Verona; find those persons out
45
      Whose names are written there, and to them say,
46
      My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.
 
47
[Exeunt CAPULET and PARIS]
 
48
Servant.
49
      Find them out whose names are written here! It is
50
      written, that the shoemaker should meddle with his
51
      yard, and the tailor with his last, the fisher with
52
      his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am
53
      sent to find those persons whose names are here
54
      writ, and can never find what names the writing
55
      person hath here writ. I must to the learned.—In good time.
 
56
[Enter BENVOLIO and ROMEO]
 
57
Benvolio.
58
      Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning,
59
      One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish;
60
      Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
61
      One desperate grief cures with another's languish:
62
      Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
63
      And the rank poison of the old will die.
64
Romeo.
65
      Your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that.
66
Benvolio.
67
      For what, I pray thee?
68
Romeo.
69
      For your broken shin.
70
Benvolio.
71
      Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
72
Romeo.
73
      Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is;
74
      Shut up in prison, kept without my food,
75
      Whipp'd and tormented and—God-den, good fellow.
76
Servant.
77
      God gi' god-den. I pray, sir, can you read?
78
Romeo.
79
      Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.
80
Servant.
81
      Perhaps you have learned it without book: but, I
82
      pray, can you read any thing you see?
83
Romeo.
84
      Ay, if I know the letters and the language.
85
Servant.
86
      Ye say honestly: rest you merry!
87
Romeo.
88
      Stay, fellow; I can read.
89
      [Reads]
90
      'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;
91
      County Anselme and his beauteous sisters; the lady
92
      widow of Vitravio; Signior Placentio and his lovely
93
      nieces; Mercutio and his brother Valentine; mine
94
      uncle Capulet, his wife and daughters; my fair niece
95
      Rosaline; Livia; Signior Valentio and his cousin
96
      Tybalt, Lucio and the lively Helena.' A fair
97
      assembly: whither should they come?
98
Servant.
99
      Up.
100
Romeo.
101
      Whither?
102
Servant.
103
      To supper; to our house.
104
Romeo.
105
      Whose house?
106
Servant.
107
      My master's.
108
Romeo.
109
      Indeed, I should have ask'd you that before.
110
Servant.
111
      Now I'll tell you without asking: my master is the
112
      great rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house
113
      of Montagues, I pray, come and crush a cup of wine.
114
      Rest you merry!
 
115
[Exit]
 
116
Benvolio.
117
      At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
118
      Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lovest,
119
      With all the admired beauties of Verona:
120
      Go thither; and, with unattainted eye,
121
      Compare her face with some that I shall show,
122
      And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.
123
Romeo.
124
      When the devout religion of mine eye
125
      Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;
126
      And these, who often drown'd could never die,
127
      Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!
128
      One fairer than my love! the all-seeing sun
129
      Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.
130
Benvolio.
131
      Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,
132
      Herself poised with herself in either eye:
133
      But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd
134
      Your lady's love against some other maid
135
      That I will show you shining at this feast,
136
      And she shall scant show well that now shows best.
137
Romeo.
138
      I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,
139
      But to rejoice in splendor of mine own.
 
140
