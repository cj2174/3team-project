A hall in Capulet’s house.

[Musicians waiting. Enter Servingmen with napkins]
 
3
First Servant.
4
      Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away? He
5
      shift a trencher? he scrape a trencher!
6
Second Servant.
7
      When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's
8
      hands and they unwashed too, 'tis a foul thing.
9
First Servant.
10
      Away with the joint-stools, remove the
11
      court-cupboard, look to the plate. Good thou, save
12
      me a piece of marchpane; and, as thou lovest me, let
13
      the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.
14
      Antony, and Potpan!
15
Second Servant.
16
      Ay, boy, ready.
17
First Servant.
18
      You are looked for and called for, asked for and
19
      sought for, in the great chamber.
20
Second Servant.
21
      We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys; be
22
      brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all.
 
23
[Enter CAPULET, with JULIET and others of his house, meeting the Guests and Maskers]
 
24
Capulet.
25
      Welcome, gentlemen! ladies that have their toes
26
      Unplagued with corns will have a bout with you.
27
      Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all
28
      Will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty,
29
      She, I'll swear, hath corns; am I come near ye now?
30
      Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
31
      That I have worn a visor and could tell
32
      A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
33
      Such as would please: 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone:
34
      You are welcome, gentlemen! come, musicians, play.
35
      A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.
36
      [Music plays, and they dance]
37
      More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,
38
      And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.
39
      Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.
40
      Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet;
41
      For you and I are past our dancing days:
42
      How long is't now since last yourself and I
43
      Were in a mask?
44
Second Capulet.
45
      By'r lady, thirty years.
46
Capulet.
47
      What, man! 'tis not so much, 'tis not so much:
48
      'Tis since the nuptials of Lucentio,
49
      Come pentecost as quickly as it will,
50
      Some five and twenty years; and then we mask'd.
51
Second Capulet.
52
      'Tis more, 'tis more, his son is elder, sir;
53
      His son is thirty.
54
Capulet.
55
      Will you tell me that?
56
      His son was but a ward two years ago.
57
Romeo.
58
      [To a Servingman]What lady is that, which doth
59
      enrich the hand
60
      Of yonder knight?
61
Servant.
62
      I know not, sir.
63
Romeo.
64
      O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
65
      It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
66
      Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear;
67
      Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
68
      So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,
69
      As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
70
      The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand,
71
      And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
72
      Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight!
73
      For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
74
Tybalt.
75
      This, by his voice, should be a Montague.
76
      Fetch me my rapier, boy. What dares the slave
77
      Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,
78
      To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
79
      Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
80
      To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.
81
Capulet.
82
      Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
83
Tybalt.
84
      Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe,
85
      A villain that is hither come in spite,
86
      To scorn at our solemnity this night.
87
Capulet.
88
      Young Romeo is it?
89
Tybalt.
90
      'Tis he, that villain Romeo.
91
Capulet.
 
92
      Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone;
93
      He bears him like a portly gentleman;
94
      And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
95
      To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth:
96
      I would not for the wealth of all the town
97
      Here in my house do him disparagement:
98
      Therefore be patient, take no note of him:
99
      It is my will, the which if thou respect,
100
      Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
101
      And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
102
Tybalt.
103
      It fits, when such a villain is a guest:
104
      I'll not endure him.
105
Capulet.
106
      He shall be endured:
107
      What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to;
108
      Am I the master here, or you? go to.
109
      You'll not endure him! God shall mend my soul!
110
      You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
111
      You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!
112
Tybalt.
113
      Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.
114
Capulet.
115
      Go to, go to;
116
      You are a saucy boy: is't so, indeed?
117
      This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what:
118
      You must contrary me! marry, 'tis time.
119
      Well said, my hearts! You are a princox; go:
120
      Be quiet, or—More light, more light! For shame!
121
      I'll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts!
122
Tybalt.
123
      Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
124
      Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
125
      I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall
126
      Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall.
 
127
[Exit]
 
128
Romeo.
 
129
      [To JULIET]If I profane with my unworthiest hand
130
      This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:
131
      My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
132
      To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
133
Juliet.
134
      Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
135
      Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
136
      For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
137
      And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
138
Romeo.
139
      Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
140
Juliet.
141
      Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
142
Romeo.
143
      O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do;
144
      They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
145
Juliet.
146
      Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
147
Romeo.
148
      Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take.
149
      Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.
150
Juliet.
151
      Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
152
Romeo.
153
      Sin from thy lips? O trespass sweetly urged!
154
      Give me my sin again.
155
Juliet.
156
      You kiss by the book.
157
Nurse.
158
      Madam, your mother craves a word with you.
159
Romeo.
160
      What is her mother?
161
Nurse.
162
      Marry, bachelor,
163
      Her mother is the lady of the house,
164
      And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous
165
      I nursed her daughter, that you talk'd withal;
166
      I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
167
      Shall have the chinks.
168
Romeo.
169
      Is she a Capulet?
170
      O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.
171
Benvolio.
172
      Away, begone; the sport is at the best.
173
Romeo.
174
      Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
175
Capulet.
176
      Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;
177
      We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
178
      Is it e'en so? why, then, I thank you all
179
      I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night.
180
      More torches here! Come on then, let's to bed.
181
      Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late:
182
      I'll to my rest.
 
183
[Exeunt all but JULIET and Nurse]
 
184
Juliet.
185
      Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?
186
Nurse.
187
      The son and heir of old Tiberio.
188
Juliet.
189
      What's he that now is going out of door?
190
Nurse.
191
      Marry, that, I think, be young Petrucio.
192
Juliet.
193
      What's he that follows there, that would not dance?
194
Nurse.
195
      I know not.
196
Juliet.
197
      Go ask his name: if he be married.
198
      My grave is like to be my wedding bed.
199
Nurse.
200
      His name is Romeo, and a Montague;
201
      The only son of your great enemy.
202
Juliet.
203
      My only love sprung from my only hate!
204
      Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
205
      Prodigious birth of love it is to me,
206
      That I must love a loathed enemy.
207
Nurse.
208
      What's this? what's this?
209
Juliet.
210
      A rhyme I learn'd even now
211
      Of one I danced withal.
 
212
[One calls within 'Juliet.']
 
213
Nurse.
214
      Anon, anon!
215
      Come, let's away; the strangers all are gone.
 
216
[Exeunt]
